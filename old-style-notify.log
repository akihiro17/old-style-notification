       The following plugins were installed with a version of Vagrant
       that had different versions of underlying components. Because
       these component versions were changed (which rarely happens),
       the plugins must be uninstalled and reinstalled.
       
       To ensure that all the dependencies are properly updated as well
       it is _highly recommended_ to do a `vagrant plugin uninstall`
       prior to reinstalling.

       You are installing an omnibus package without a version pin.  If you are installing
       on production servers via an automated process this is DANGEROUS and you will
       be upgraded without warning on new releases, even to new major releases.
       Letting the version float is only appropriate in desktop, test, development or
       CI/CD environments.
